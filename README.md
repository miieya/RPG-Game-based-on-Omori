# RPG-Game-based-on-Omori
I write a small game demo based on the RPG game Omori. The battle part is still to be perfected, there are some small bugs. 

I am very fond of this game, which led me to create a demo inspired by it for my end-of-semester project during my freshman year. Due to my limited skills, I was only able to complete this task in the console. I implemented keyboard controls for character movement on the map. As for the turn-based combat, there are still some bugs that haven't been fixed.
